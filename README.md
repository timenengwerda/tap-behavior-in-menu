# tap-behavior-in-menu
When a submenu is present the first tap of the parent item opens the submenu. Tapping it again will navigate to the parent's href.

Usage is simple, call <code>responsiveMenuInit</code> with the UL of your choice as a parameter:

<code>responsiveMenuInit($('ul.menu'));</code>
